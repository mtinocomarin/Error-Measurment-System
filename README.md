This project focuses on developing a Python-based motor skill acquisition error measurement system as part of a research initiative led by Professor Juliana Parma in the Skill Acquisition and Neuroscience Lab at San Francisco State University's Department of Kinesiology. The lab studies motor learning by analyzing participants’ performance in an adapted shuffleboard task, where they slide a puck across a table toward a designated target at the center of a 9x9 grid. Each grid square measures 3 cm x 3 cm, and the puck is a 2 cm diameter circle. After each trial, the puck’s final position is photographed, and these images are analyzed to calculate error distances, which are essential for the lab’s research.
Currently, the lab relies on a paid LabView-based system for post-image processing. While functional, this software costs approximately $400 and has several limitations. Users must process each image individually, manually select the puck’s position, and save the results (including trial data and participant information) to a text file. Errors, such as misclicks, often require restarting the process entirely, leading to significant delays, especially when working with large datasets. Furthermore, the current system lacks advanced features such as scatter plot visualizations, intuitive navigation, and flexible file management, limiting its usability and efficiency.
To address these challenges, the project team developed a free, open-source Python-based program tailored to the lab’s specific research needs. This tool streamlines the calculation of error measurements, improves user experience, and enhances efficiency. The new system includes several key features:
A Graphical User Interface (GUI): An intuitive interface simplifies navigation and enhances usability.
Error Correction: Users can undo misclicks and revisit previous images without restarting the process.
Customizable Outputs: Results can be saved in preferred formats, including detailed calculations such as the distance between two points, x-axis and y-axis values, and radial distance data.
Scatter Plot Visualizations: These tools enable researchers to visualize error patterns and gain clearer insights into the data.
Flexibility and Customization: The program supports additional features requested by researchers, replicating or enhancing the functionality of the LabView system.
In addition to these features, the program has been designed to meet specific goals: it automates data and image processing workflows, supports batch processing of images, saves calculations in standardized formats, and provides functionality to define axis orientations and ranges. Statistical summaries and visualizations further support the lab's research, making the tool not only efficient but also user-friendly and versatile.
By meeting these requirements, the system overcomes the limitations of the current tool, offering a cost-effective and accessible solution for the lab’s motor learning research. Furthermore, its open-source nature ensures that other researchers studying motor skill acquisition can freely adopt and adapt the tool for their own studies. This project represents a significant advancement in facilitating and enhancing research workflow.
